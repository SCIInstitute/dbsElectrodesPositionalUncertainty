Code for Visualization of synthetic 2D data -  refer to files in a directory syntheticDataCode/2DGaussianSynthetic/

Code for Visualization of synthetic 3D data -  refer to files in a directory syntheticDataCode/3DGaussianSynthetic/

Code for Visualization of real 3D data -  refer to files in a directory syntheticDataCode/realDataCode/


**Important**

Refer to ReadMe files in respective directories for instructions on how to run code.


*** The code in syntheticDataCode/3DGaussianSynthetic/ and syntheticDataCode/realDataCode/ will ERROR OUT, since we can not make a few data, such as
high-resolution image of DBS lead electrodes and patient data, publicly available. If you would like access to these data, please reach out to one of the 
authors of the paper.

However, you will still be able to produce visualizations reported in the paper into ParaView using our pre-generated visualization files.
Please refer to ReadMe files in respective folders for more information on how to produce visualizations.
